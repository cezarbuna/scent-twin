### 3. **Goal Selection Interface** (`src/app/features/auth/goal-selection/`)
**Visual Design:**
- Interactive goal cards with hover effects
- Multiple selection support (required at least 1)
- 7 goal options:
  - 💼 **Work / Office** - Professional & Subtle
  - ☀️ **Casual Day** - Everyday Versatile
  - ❤️ **Date Night** - Romantic & Intimate
  - 🌙 **Night Out** - Bold & Attention-Grabbing

- **Fragrance Families:**
  - Fresh (citrus, aquatic, green)
  - Floral (rose, jasmine, lavender)
  - Amber/Oriental (vanilla, spices, resins)
  - Woody (cedar, sandalwood, vetiver)

### 4. **Shared Components**

#### **Tooltip Component** (`src/app/shared/components/tooltip/`)
- Info icon (ⓘ) trigger button
- Hover and click activation
- Positioning options (top, bottom, left, right)
- Mobile: Bottom sheet style
- Desktop: Floating popover
- Dark glassmorphism background

#### **Progress Stepper** (`src/app/shared/components/progress-stepper/`)
- 5-step onboarding visualization
- Steps:
  1. Create Account ✓
  2. Select Goals ← (current)
  3. Selfie (Optional)
  4. Preferences Quiz
  5. Get Recommendations
- Animated progress indicators
- Checkmarks for completed steps
- Pulsing effect for current step
- Responsive sizing

### 5. **Routing Configuration** (`src/app/app.routes.ts`)
```typescript
/auth → /auth/sign-in (default)
/auth/sign-in → Sign In Component
/auth/sign-up → Sign Up Component
/goals → Goal Selection Component (protected)
```

**Route Protection:**
- `/auth` routes use `guestGuard` (redirects authenticated users)
- `/goals` uses `authGuard` (requires authentication)
- Auth guard checks authentication and redirects to `/welcome` if not logged in

### 6. **Auth Guards** (`src/app/core/guards/auth.guard.ts`)
- **authGuard**: Protects routes requiring authentication
- **guestGuard**: Prevents authenticated users from accessing auth pages
- Functional guards using Angular's inject API

## 🔒 Security & Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. **Sign Up:**
   - User submits email + password
   - Supabase creates auth user
   - Auth service creates `user_profiles` record
   - User authenticated and redirected to `/goals`

2. **Sign In:**
   - User submits credentials
   - Supabase validates
   - Auth service fetches user profile
   - Checks if `primaryGoals` array is populated
   - Redirects to `/goals` if empty, else `/recommendations`

3. **Google OAuth:**
   - User clicks "Continue with Google"
   - Supabase initiates OAuth flow
   - Redirects to Google
   - Google redirects back to `/auth/callback`
   - User authenticated automatically

### Goal Selection Flow
1. User selects one or more goals (multi-select)
2. Clicks "Continue" button
3. `updateUserGoals()` called with selected goal IDs
4. Equal scenario weights calculated (1.0 / number of goals)
5. Supabase updates `user_profiles` table
6. User redirected to `/selfie` (next onboarding step)

## 🙏 Notes

- **Google OAuth Setup**: To enable Google sign-in in production, you'll need to:
  1. Create a Google Cloud project
  2. Enable Google OAuth API
  3. Get Client ID and Client Secret
  4. Add to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
  5. Add redirect URLs to Google Console

- **Email Confirmation**: Supabase can be configured to require email verification before sign-in. This is currently disabled for development but should be enabled in production.

- **Password Reset**: The reset link expires after 1 hour by default (configurable in Supabase).
